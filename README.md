# Photo-Sharing-App
This app enables users to share pictures with each other using CloudKit, and it randomly fetches pictures from the past to share with the user as memories. It uses CloudKit Discover to find contacts that use the same app, and features other CloudKit tools such as subscriptions and push notifications. The app also keeps track of geolocation data associated with each photo. At random intervals, the application uses background fetch to get a random photo from the cloud, and presents it to the user.
